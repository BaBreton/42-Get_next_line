# 42-Get_next_line

Get_next_line is a 42 school project that involves coding the get_next_line() function.
This function returns the lines one by one, of a file descriptor sent as a parameter.


### Options

There are two versions of the get_next_line() function.
* The mandatory version, which takes a file descriptor as a parameter.
* The bonus version lets you manage several file descriptors at once.
